# Dreamer.py

Asks you what you want the Python program to do and uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo engine to create a Python script for it and give the user the option to automatically run it. Also installs required libraries and automatic naming (following Python standards). 

# RUN?

After generating the program, it will give you the option to automatically run it. 
The program is then stored in the /generated_programs folder and opened (appropriate to OS). 

# LIMITATIONS

You should only really say 'yes' to automatically run the program if the the generated program wouldn't need additional files (ie. images) otherwise it'll often just crash. Due to the nature of the model, it might try and use links to files that are outdated or no longer exist, so you might need to fix that. If you have a link in mind already it may be handy to paste it into the prompt

## NOTE: You must set your OpenAI API Key
In Terminal, 

    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    #run this to check if it is set
    echo $OPENAI_API_KEY


## INSTALL

    cd where/you/want/it
    git clone https://github.com/jansdhillon/Dreamer.git
